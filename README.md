# GEOG5995Assignment2

This repository consists of Python code which has been written in order to satisy the requirements of Assignment 2 in the 
GEOG5995 Programming for Social Scientists course at University of Leeds.

The code uses data from the NHS Digital (2016) survey on Smoking, Drinking and Drug Use in Young People to examine the effects of drug use on adolescent wellbeing. The file 'sdd_archive.tab' is needed in order for the code to work, which cannot be included in this repository for privacy purposes, however it can be obtained from the following link:

The code begins with loading the data into Python, before some cleaning is done to deal with missing values and binary variables, followed by some descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis. The main use of the programme is to create various linear regression models which examine the effects of drug use on self-reported adolescent wellbeing.
